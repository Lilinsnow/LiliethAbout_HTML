          <h3>Lilieth versus Lilith</h3>
          <p>
            When I introduce myself, many times people mispronounce my name and
            call me Lilith. This can be very flattering since Lilith is one of
            the main goddesses of the Mesopotamian pantheons
          </p>
          <span class="desktop-only">
            <p>Lady Lilith by Dante Gabriel Rossetti</p>
            <p>
              However, on a not so flattering side, Lilith comes from the word
              lilîtu, the feminine form of a word meaning “demon” or “spirit”.
              And in the Old Testament Lilith was the first wife of Adam who was
              ultimately banished from the Garden of Eden for her disobedience.
            </p>
            <p>
              Well that doesn’t quite describe me, except for the “Disobedient”
              part. Now don’t take this the wrong way, I like rules when they
              are made for the greater good. However, sometimes rules can be
              limiting and creativity stoppers. The greatest geniuses in history
              didn’t get far by following all the rules. Take Albert Einstein
              for example; he was one of the world’s most natural rule breakers.
              He was willing to bend rules and see beyond a problem. I do like
              to see beyond the problem and maybe that is why I ultimately
              became an Engineer and continue to explore and learn.

        <h3>The meaning of my Name</h3>
        <p>
          So because I’m not a fan of the meaning of Lilith and it’s negative
          connotation, I prefer a more positive twist to the meaning of my name.
          Lets break it down by letter:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            L is for little, the little things I do, the details that make a
            difference
          </li>
          <li>
            I is for instill, the lessons and ideas I gradually establish on my
            kids
          </li>
          <li>
            L is for love, everlasting love I have for my children and my family
          </li>
          <li>
            I is for inspire, I strive to inspire others that anyone can learn
            anything no matter your age
          </li>
          <li>
            E is for expressive; I am not one to hold within, I say what I need
            to say
          </li>
          <li>
            T is for treasure; I treasure every friendship I build along the way
          </li>
          <li>
            H is for hope, the encouragement I give to everyone I meet to go the
            distance no matter how hard it gets
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Ultimately, most people call me LiLi!</p>

            My husband says I am thoughtful, considerate, organized, passionate,
            and very persistent. Well, I can agree with most of that; specially
            the stubborn part. <strong>HA HA Ha!!</strong>And I can have a bit
            of OCD (obsessive compulsive disorder) when it comes to keeping my
            house in order. And because of this passion of order and
            cleanliness, I have had plans of writing a book about how to keep
            your home in order with a few simple steps.
          </p>
          <!-- create a linkable text by adding a href and the link next to the word that will be hyperlinked and add target='_blank' to it open in a make new window and keep the reader in your page. -->
          <p>
            I started a blog a few years ago called
            <a href="https://moppinginheels.com/" target="_blank"
              >"Mopping in Heels"</a
            >, where I shared my findings and my frustrations of mom life and
            solutions to the stresses a mom goes through. I guess I should go
            back to writing because it served me as therapy. When you write
            about your experiences as a parent, it's a way to let things go and
            make space for what really matters as a parent. The most difficult
            job I have ever had in my life, has been to be a mom. But I wouldn't
            change it for anything. It is the reason I decided to go freelance
            and continue to learn and keep myself updated to be able to work and
            be a mom.
          </p>
          <p>
            On a more upbeat note, I am also known for throwing a good party. I
            love bringing people together. One of my side hustles while I was
            taking time off from work to raise my kids, was an event planning
            business. I launched a website called
            <a href="https://fetesdelili.com/" target="_blank"
              >"Fêtes de Lili"</a
            >
            and did some awesome baby showers and kid parties back in the day
            when my children were small. This also led me to creating an
            Instagram account to post all the pictures of my events and
            inspirations. That page and Instagram account have now evolved to a
            different focus in my life - moving to France from Miami in 2018 and
            starting a new life as an expat.

            I didn't know anything about this word, EXPAT. I have known about
            being an imigrant because of my experience moving from Honduras to
            Miami in 1984. I knew that starting a new life in a new country from
            scratch was part of the immigrant journey. But this time moving to
            France was not the same. My husband came with a job, we came with
            our life savings and we were doing it just because we had the means
            to do so and we wanted to explore. I guess the difference between
            being an Expat and being an Immigrant, is that as an Expat you are
            coming in with your own means and do not look for anything from the
            country you are moving into. No need for a job or government help,
            you live like a permanent tourist. You basically come just to live
            and enjoy the culture.
          </p>
          <p>
            This big adventure turned into a series of notetaking and
            organization of information, which then resulted in a Podcast I
            called "Startup in Heels". My podcast was my way to keep my sanity
            during COVID19 pandemic in 2021.

            I am a MIX of cultures. I was born to a Honduran couple in Bronx,
            New York and then spent most of my childhood growing up in Honduras.
            Then at the age of twelve my parents decided to migrate to the
            United States, following the American dream. I guess you can say I
            am more American than Honduran, but I like to see myself as a
            rainbow of colors that continues to transform with the experiences
            life brings. I have spent 4 years living in the South of France and
            have added some French Culture things to my mix. Now living in
            Spain, I am slowly adjusting and grabbing more hints of color along
            the way.

      <h2>My Favorite Things</h2>
      <div class="responsive">
        <section id="favs">
          <h3>My Love for Old Movies</h3>
          <blockquote>
            “Raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens Bright copper kettles
            and warm woolen mittens Brown paper packages tied up with strings
            These are a few of my favorite things…”
            <p>Lyrics from The Sound of Music Sound Track</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            The Sound of Music is definitely one of my favorite classics. My dad
            had a LP of the soundtrack to the movie when I was a kid and I used
            to play it sometimes in the afternoons during summer vacation. I
            have always been a lover of old movies.
          </p>
          <p>
            I guess my father’s LP collection was an influence on me. The other
            movie soundtrack he had was West Side Story – “Maria, the most
            beautiful word that I’ve ever heard…”; I can sing all the songs from
            the movie. I got so excited when Disney came out with a remake of
            the West Side Story. I guess it was a story I connected with when I
            myself became an immigrant in the United States. Even though I was
            born in New York, my root culture has always been Honduran and thus
            makes me an immigrant.
          </p>
          <p>
            Aside from those two classics, a few of my favorite movies that I
            can watch over and over again are:
          </p>
          <p>
            Dirty Dancing, Sixteen Candles, Breakfast Club, Ferris Bueller’s Day
            Off, Weird Science, Gremlins, Terminator (ALL OF THEM), GhostBusters
            (All of Them) and the list goes on. I am mostly a big fan of the
            80s.

            Lifestyle has become a common word being used to label how you live

            and economic level. I have seen this word used so commonly in
            advertising to lure you in. Let me Lure you into my world and see

          <h3>My Habits</h3>
          <p>
            Have you ever had a morning where you wake up before everyone at
            home and just enjoy the silence with a cup of coffee and a sweet
            pastry? That is one habit I started when living in France in a small
            two-bedroom apartment with my two kids, two dogs and my husband.
            Because our space was tight, we didn’t really have quiet time. So
            during the pandemic of COVID19 in 2020 thru 2021, I needed to find
            time to get some silence and me time, so I started the habit of
            waking up before everyone in my house, even if its just 30 minutes.
            No matter how tired I am, I get up to have that me time.

        <h3>My Attitude</h3>
        <p>
          The word attitude has a negative connotation for me because in
          American culture it is used to describe when someone treats you
          without respect. But giving it a positive meaning, I would say my
          attitude is the way I approach a challenge. One of the most
          challenging jobs I have ever had in my life has been that of being a
          mom. My attitude towards parenting has been to always try to improve.
          Each parenting stage comes with challenges and the only way to survive
          it is by learning how to treat my kids with respect, teach them about
          what I have learned in my life and learn along with them about the new
          and changing times we are faced with. My attitude to a problem or
          challenge is education; just take the time to figure things out.

            We can talk about taste from food to clothing or love life. To keep
            it short, let me share with you my taste for food. I just LOVE LOVE
            LOVE FRENCH CUISINE! I have had a curiousity about France for a long
            time. I didn’t quite know why until I lived in France for four
            years. In my opinion, the French are the best at pastries and just
            taking food seriously. Every plate has it’s uniqueness. I guess I am
            a lover of butter, cheese, milk products, chocolates and OH MY GOD
            DUCK CONFIT!

          <p>
            Being a daughter of a traditional Latin couple, where the man works
            and the woman stays at home to take care of the house and the kids,
            I was raised with certain guidelines of what is right and
            acceptable. I cannot say I’m a traditional Latina Woman. I believe
            in equality for all and a balance at home. My moral compass is about
            treating everyone with respect and compassion. I believe that it
            should not matter what economic standing you are in, everyone around
            you deserves to be treated with respect. I believe in inclusivity
            and in lending a hand to those with need.

            One of my strongest missions is to bring equality in technology for
            women. I believe girls are not given the same opportunities as men
            when it comes to tech education and growth in tech. This is why as a
            side hustle, I teach Robotics to children and I try to get little
            girls excited about Math and Technology. I have participated in
            First Lego League Robotics Competitions in the United States and in
            France. This is a passion of mine and I hope to continue it for the
            rest of my life. I truly believe that the future is in our children
            and we need to encourage little girls that they also can be
            engineers and scientists. Technology doesn’t have to be
            overwhelming, we just need better teachers to know how to encourage
            women instead of making them feel incapable.
